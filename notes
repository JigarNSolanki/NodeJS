=> JWT
A JSON web token(JWT) is JSON Object which is used to securely transfer information over the web
(between two parties). It can be used for an authentication system and can also be used for 
information exchange.
In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:
1. Header
2. Payload
3. Signature

=> jsonwebtoken module
A module to implement JWT

=> express-jwt module
A module that provides Express middleware for validating JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) through the jsonwebtoken module.

==> Async function
Async functions are available natively in Node and are denoted by the async keyword in their declaration.
They always return a promise, even if you donâ€™t explicitly write them to do so. Also, the await keyword is 
only available inside async functions at the moment - it cannot be used in the global scope.
In an async function, you can await any Promise or catch its rejection cause.
